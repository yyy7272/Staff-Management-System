  ðŸ”§ Technical Considerations

  Each feature leverages the existing architecture:
  - Real-time features can extend the current SignalR collaboration system
  - Authentication & permissions already handle role-based access
  - Database architecture supports additional entities and relationships
  - Frontend components provide reusable UI patterns
  - API patterns established for consistent endpoint development

  Would you like me to elaborate on any specific feature or help implement one of these enhancements?
